# chkbat
Low-battery warning utility for laptop. (for Linux only)

Since the system's warning always be ignored when I keeping my mind on work, and give me a shock when the laptop shutting down due to the battery has no enough power. So, I create this script to alarm me to plug-in the power line.

Add this script to crontab or systemd to run it.
